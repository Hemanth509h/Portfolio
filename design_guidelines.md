# Developer Portfolio Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from modern developer portfolios like Linear, GitHub, and Vercel, emphasizing clean aesthetics with professional credibility. The dark theme with blue accents creates a tech-forward, developer-focused identity.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Dark Mode Primary**:
- Background: 220 15% 8% (deep navy-black)
- Surface: 220 15% 12% (elevated dark surface)
- Text Primary: 220 10% 95% (crisp white)
- Text Secondary: 220 8% 70% (muted gray)

**Blue Accent System**:
- Primary Blue: 210 100% 60% (vibrant blue for CTAs)
- Blue Subtle: 210 40% 25% (dark blue backgrounds)
- Blue Glow: 210 80% 50% (hover states, borders)

### Typography
- **Primary**: Inter or Geist (Google Fonts)
- **Code/Mono**: JetBrains Mono or Fira Code
- **Hierarchy**: text-5xl for hero, text-3xl for sections, text-lg for body

### Layout System
**Spacing**: Use Tailwind units of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 for consistent rhythm
- Sections: py-24 spacing between major sections
- Cards: p-6 or p-8 for content padding
- Container: max-w-6xl mx-auto for content width

### Component Library

**Navigation**:
- Fixed header with glass morphism effect (backdrop-blur)
- Blue accent on active nav items
- Smooth scroll navigation between sections

**Hero Section**:
- Full viewport height with developer introduction
- Animated typing effect for role/specialization
- Subtle gradient overlay: 220 15% 8% to 210 40% 12%
- CTA buttons with blue primary and outline variants

**Project Cards**:
- Dark surface background (220 15% 12%)
- Blue accent borders on hover
- Tech stack badges with blue color scheme
- Live demo and GitHub link buttons

**Skills Grid**:
- Technology icons with blue accent highlights
- Organized by categories (Frontend, Backend, Tools)
- Subtle hover animations

**Contact Section**:
- Clean contact form with blue focus states
- Social media links with blue hover effects
- Professional email and location display

### Visual Treatments
**Gradients**: Subtle blue-to-dark gradients for section dividers and card backgrounds
**Shadows**: Soft blue-tinted shadows for depth (shadow-blue-500/10)
**Borders**: Blue accent borders (border-blue-500/30) for interactive elements

## Images
**Hero Background**: Subtle tech-themed pattern or abstract geometric shapes in dark blue tones
**Project Screenshots**: High-quality mockups of development work, properly sized for cards
**Profile Photo**: Professional headshot for about section (optional)

## Key Design Principles
- **Professional Minimalism**: Clean, focused layout without clutter
- **Blue as Enhancement**: Blue accents guide attention, not dominate
- **Developer-Centric**: Code snippets, terminal aesthetics, tech iconography
- **Performance Focus**: Lightweight design with smooth interactions
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios, proper focus states

This creates a sophisticated developer portfolio that balances visual appeal with professional credibility, using the dark theme and blue accents strategically to enhance rather than overwhelm the content.
